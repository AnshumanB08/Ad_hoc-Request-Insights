# 📊 Ad\_Hoc Request Insights — SQL Analysis

## 🚀 Project Overview

**Company:** *AtliQ Hardwares* (Imaginary Company) **|**
**Industry:** Computer Hardware **|**
**Region:** India & International

AtliQ Hardwares is one of India’s leading computer hardware producers with a strong global presence. However, the company’s management noticed a lack of quick, actionable insights for strategic, data-driven decision-making.

To address this, Tony Sharma (Data Analytics Director) decided to expand the data analytics team and designed an **SQL challenge** to evaluate candidates' technical and soft skills.

This project is my submission for that challenge — showcasing my ability to extract business insights using SQL.

As an applicant, I have:

* Explored and analyzed the provided database (`gdb023`)
* Written **clean and efficient SQL queries** to answer each  business request
* Created a **Power BI dashboard and presentation** to communicate insights effectively
